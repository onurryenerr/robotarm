* Calibrate servos. Check servo.attach min max,
Check if servo library utilize linearization

*When performing photo to vector, use 250x250 matrix.
After when performing cartesian to alphabetta,
Delete consecutive same elements.

*Use for loop and modulo operation for motor speed control.
Use millis instead of delay. 

*Kalemin icunu indirirken hizini belli bir noktadan sonra azalt.
Ya da kontrol et.

*Kalemin ucunu kaldirirken kalkarken alfa bettanin
Hareket edip yazmamasi icin, kalktiktan sonra delay koy

*Motors precision are increased now. Consider
Using write.milliseconds instead of delay. Still
Use it as dummy delay. Guarantee each iteration
In the loop is done in a constant time

*Use linearization. Probably map() function.
Consider the drawbacks.

*Use two bytes for each angle. 

*Consider transforming
Degree to milliseconds in rapsberry pi

*Consider using differential data format,
Requires new transmission protocol

*Consider using ssi or i2c instead of uart

*Think about using micros(). Read this
